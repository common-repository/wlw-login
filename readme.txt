Requires at least: 2.3.1
Tested up to: 2.3.3
Stable tag: 1.0

Includes the Windows Live Writer manifest link on the login page also, for secured blogs.

== Description ==

If you use a plugin like [Private WP](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/private-wp/) to make your blog available only to
registered users, then the auto-configuration ability of Windows Live Writer no longer works for your blog. To make Windows
Live Writer work again, install this plugin. It will make sure that the configuration files for Windows Live Writer are linked
from the login page, which does the trick.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wlw-login` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate WLW Login through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Done!
